## Understanding the Leadership Principles 
When the interviewer says something like "Well, that's a good start, what else?", **do not** answer that "Nope, that's it."

### Customer Obsession
Every decision prioritizes the customer as the highest importance.

- It is common to make decisions at Amazon that lowered profit/sales because it was the right thing to do for customers
- In a large company, people tend to view the product team who gave them requirements as the customer, while ignoring the real needs of customers.
- It is expected to demonstrate customer obsession in your answers.

### Ownership
Leaders are owners and act for the long-term value of the company.

-  Leaders are responsible for what they own.
- Sometimes there are two owners for one application, and both two owners share the responsibility to handle the issue

### Invent and Simplify
Amazon is all about innovation. The other half of the principle is the idea of simplification.

- There is always another solution. We all have the capacity for infinite ideas.
- KISS principle(Keep it simple, stupid!). The simplest solution is the one you can maintain.
- The best engineers often **remove code**

### Are Right, A Lot
Leaders make the right decision for most of the situation.

- People with strong judgment and good instincts are preferred.
- Every perspective and opinion needs to be valued.

### Learn and Be Curious
Never stop learning.

- What worked before may not work today.
- One Amazon project was first written in Perl, and then moved to C, and moved to Java.
- Do not be obsessed with any tool or technology. What Amazon needs is to be open and interested in learning new things.

### Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders recognize talented people and train them.

- It is necessary to find top performers and treat them differently.
- If you’re comfortable, you’re not growing.
- It’s the responsibility of every single person to help others grow.

**? It is a bit controversial to encourage both competition and collaboration.**

### Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards.

- We should never be satisfied with what we have. Never deliver to requirements.
- Never accept that something is broken, even though it is acceptable for the customer and others.

### Think big
- When asked for an idea, don't say the first small idea which pops in your head, and believe you’ve satisfied the requirement.
